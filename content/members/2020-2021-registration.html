            The Pittsburgh Curling Club COVID-19 protocols remain in place for the 2021 Spring/Summer session. It is our
            intent to continue to operate safely under these guidelines until the pandemic abates. The PghCC is
            committing
            both the funds and effort necessary to keep the ice and provide the best possible curling experience to our
            membership during this uncertain time. In return, we ask that you support the PghCC and understand that if
            club operations are shut down by order of the State of Pennsylvania or the County of Allegheny, we will be
            unable to provide either full or partial refunds to our membership. By registering as a member, you agree to
            assume that risk
