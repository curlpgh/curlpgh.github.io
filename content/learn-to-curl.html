          <h3 class="mt-3">Do I need any equipment?</h3>
          No! We have all the equipment you need to learn to curl. Just be sure to wear warm, comfortable clothing
          -track pants or sweatpants work best, and athletic rubber soled shoes such as tennis shoes. You’ll be good to
          go!!

          <h3 class="mt-3">Is curling hard to do?</h3>
          Curling is easy to learn and fun to play right from the first stone you throw. Most everyone we meet has seen
          curling televised at the Winter Olympics – looks easy, right? Curling is a sport of strategy and finesse and,
          as with any sport, the more you do it the better at it you become.

          <h3 class="mt-3">Who can “Learn-to-Curl”? Can my kids try it?</h3>
          Curling is a “lifetime” sport for people of all ages and abilities. Children are welcome to try curling!! Kids
          about 11 years and up are generally able to participate. We can also accommodate wheelchair curlers and those
          who may not be as flexible as they once were with “stick” curling. Don’t know what that is? Don’t worry, just
          come to the sessions and we’ll get you curling. Waivers must be signed by all participants. Parents or legal
          guardians must sign waivers for children under 18 years of age. Waivers are available at curling sessions or
          you can download one <a href="/docs/waivers/waiver-new-2020-w-email.pdf">here</a>.

          <h3 class="mt-3">What if I like it?</h3>
          You can join the Pittsburgh Curling Club as an individual, couple, team or even a group. We can help by
          placing you on a team with more experienced players or we can help you organize your team. Last season the
          club had over 140 members and many members travel to other clubs to compete in curling tournaments called
          bonspiels.
